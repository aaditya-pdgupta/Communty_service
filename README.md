I have worked as a vice president of the child club from the age of fourteen, where I engaged in different programs organized by various NGOs and INGOs, such as UNESCO Nepal, ABC Nepal, etc. Due to our great effort and commitment, we were able to announce our municipality as a Child-Friendly Local Governance (CFLG) municipality in the country, which was a great accomplishment for the club and the municipality.
